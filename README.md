# Personal Web Page
 Personal web page using nextjs and Tailwindcss

In short, the tech stack of the website is as follows:

- Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Styling: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Icons: [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)
- Deployment: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Overview
- `app/*`: I have used next.js new `app` directory structure. This directory contains the main app.
- `components/*`: All custom components are stored in this directory.
- `public/*`: This directory contains all the static assets of the website.
- `public/content/*`: This directory contains all the static contents of the website. e.g. projects, experiences, education, etc.
- `styles/*`: I have used Tailwind CSS for styling. This directory contains the Tailwind CSS global styles and some custom styles for the website.
